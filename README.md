# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

I completed this task as part of the 03 challenge for Javascript. This site will allow you to generate a password with 8 to 128 characters. You also get to choose whether your password includes special, uppercase, lowercase, and or numeric characters. Coding this project really helped me get a grip on the logic of Javascript and understand how to use functions and event listeners to manipulate the HTML DOM how we want.


## Installation

No need to install just run in browser. Link to deployed APP : https://n8hoang.github.io/03-challenge-Password-Gen/Develop/

## Usage

Click generate a password and you will be prompted with how long you want the password to be(8 to 128 characters). You will then be asked if you want to include special, uppercase, lowercase, and or numeric characters in your password. Once all the prompts are done the password will be generated inside the box on the page.
